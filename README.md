# Template Engine API

This repository has a template API that allows to use multiple engine:

* env var text engine
* json template
* pebble template
* thymeleaf template


See the [tests](src/test/java/com/combostrap/template) for examples.

You need to add the engine in your `pom`. We don't provide it.
